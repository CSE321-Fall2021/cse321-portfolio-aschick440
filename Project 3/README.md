Project Description:  
_This program will function as an embedded pictionary game withair drawing functionality. The users can make guesses and tallypoints by using the keypad. The LED Matrix will always display the drawers picture by monitoring arm motions with IRS._

Getting Started
--------------------
* Connect the Nucleo to your computer using the USB.
* Connect 3.3V or 5V to the + terminal on the breadboard
* Connect gnd to the - terminal on the breadboard
* Keypad :
* subset col1 -> PE_6
* Clean build and run

**THESE ARE JUST INITIAL THOUGHTS ON LAYOUT**
The program will begin in an initialization phase where it waits for the userâ€™s location data. Then, the next initialization will be on relative DTH11 sensor mapping, the program needs these two user inputs to begin. Once these have been given, the final initialization will take place which computes how the dot matrix will display based on positioning of each DTH11 sensor. Every ~30 minutes there will be a ticker attached to an ISR to grab the current weather data. Outside of that, one thread will be constantly updating the dot map while the other thread computes the safe humidity levels and relative humidity levels of each room. If the humidity levels become too unsafe there will be an interrupt triggered that sets off the Buzzer and gives the user an LCD prompt to turn on the humidifier. Until a safe level is restored the buzzer will not turn off.
